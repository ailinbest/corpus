1. Tencent AI Lab Embedding Corpus for Chinese Words and Phrases

   https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/nlp/embedding.html

   This corpus provides 200-dimension vector representations, a.k.a. embeddings, for over 8 million Chinese words and phrases, which are pre-trained on large-scale high-quality data. These vectors, capturing semantic meanings for Chinese words and phrases, can be widely applied in many downstream Chinese processing tasks (e.g., named entity recognition and text classification) and in further research.
